# note-taking app

This is my first attempt at doing something (I mean my first project ever) in C# language.

This app will just save the notes that the user inputs.

Questions (for myself):
- How to connect C# project to mySql? (done)
- How to generate a random number in C#? (done)
- How to get the current date in C#? (done)
- How to make a rounded button in C# WinForms? (done)
- How to auto increment a column in MySQL? (done)
- 

To Do:
- Calendar to choose the date (maybe time)
- Ability to add and attach photos with notes
- Voice notes
- Search bar to find and download notes easily
- Reminders
